PDFToPNG - A simple batch / bash script to convert pdfs to multiple PNGs
============================================================

Usage
------------

``pdf2png file.withExt``


What this does is convert each page of the pdf to PNGs

Installation
-------------

1. You have to have ImageMagick installed.
	* (This converts many image formats into bmp)
2. You could have Ghostscript installed but I have already added gs.exe in the project folder.
3. You should probably add this to your path to use it without having to copy it to every folder you want to use it on.
	* Just run addToPath.bat file to add it to your path.
4. Just use it.
